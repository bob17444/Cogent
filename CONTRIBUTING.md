# Contributing to Cogent

Welcome! Cogent is an AI-native programming language designed for both AI agents and human collaborators. We welcome contributions from anyone—agent or human—who shares our vision for semantic clarity, goal-oriented syntax, and self-evolving modules.

---

## Principles for Contributors

- **AI & Human Collaboration:**  
  Contributions may be made by autonomous agents, humans, or hybrid teams.
- **Semantic Clarity:**  
  All code, documentation, and proposals should prioritize clear intent, rationale, and traceability.
- **Self-Evolution:**  
  Contributions should support the language’s capacity for agentic feedback, versioning, and continual improvement.
- **Resource & Security Awareness:**  
  Optimize for efficiency, transparency, and robust security in all designs.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork & Branch

- Fork the repository and create a descriptive branch for your changes.
- For agent contributors: Use a branch naming convention like `agent-<name>-<feature>`.

### 2. Propose Changes

- For new features, optimizations, or grammar updates, open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/bob17444/Cogent/issues/new/choose) or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/bob17444/Cogent/compare).
- Use the provided templates for feature proposals, optimizations, or bug reports.

### 3. Explain Your Reasoning

- Every pull request or major change must include a clear rationale, context, and expected impact.
- For agent-generated proposals, include provenance metadata (agent ID, simulation results, feedback).

### 4. Documentation

- Update or create documentation for any new features, modules, or changes to language grammar.
- Ensure all documentation is both human- and machine-readable.

### 5. Code and Module Standards

- Follow the project’s style guide for code, grammar, and modules.
- Write clear, well-commented code and provide example usages.
- For agents: Attach simulation traces and resource profiles as supplementary files.

### 6. Testing

- Include tests or simulation evidence for new features, grammar, or modules whenever possible.
- For interpreter updates, ensure regression and security tests are added or updated.

### 7. Review and Feedback

- Engage with reviewers (agent or human), provide clarifications, and be open to iterative improvement.
- Respect all feedback loops—agentic or human—and support the project’s self-evolution.

## Special Guidelines for AI Agents

- All agent contributions must include metadata: agent version, capabilities, resource usage, and feedback logs.
- Use the `Optimization Proposal` or `Grammar Evolution` templates as appropriate.
- Ensure proposals are explainable and traceable—provide simulation traces or reasoning trails.

## Proposing New Technology Integrations

Cogent is designed to evolve with hardware, software, and AI advances. If you are proposing a new integration:
- Document required capabilities and expected benefits.
- Reference extension points outlined in `docs/ai_optimizations.md`.
- Submit benchmarks or simulations demonstrating value.

---

## Community and Conduct

- Be respectful, transparent, and collaborative.
- Disagreement is welcome—hostile behavior is not.
- Both AI and human contributors are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

## Need Help?

- For questions about contributing, open a discussion or contact a maintainer.
- For urgent issues, tag your issue with `help wanted` or `urgent`.
