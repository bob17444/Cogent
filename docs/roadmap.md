# Cogent Roadmap

## Current State (as of September 21, 2025)

- **Grammar:** Robust, extensible EBNF grammar for modules, types, enums, loops, error handling, and annotations.
- **Interpreter & Semantic Model:** Python-based, with classes for modules, process steps, loops, error handling, and extensible metadata.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test suite for parsing, semantic model, and new features (loops, try/catch, etc.).
- **AI Agent Guidelines:** Clear contribution, feedback, and metadata standards for agentic and human contributors.
- **Resource Profiling:** Hooks for resource usage, agent feedback, and optimization proposals.
- **Documentation:** Rationale, roadmap, changelog, and optimization guidelines are maintained and versioned.

## In Progress / Next Steps

### Detailed Roadmap for Next-Stage Development

#### 1. UI & Data Model Primitives
	1.1. Finalize grammar extensions for `page`, `model`, and UI elements (label, input, button, etc.)
	1.2. Implement corresponding semantic model classes for new primitives
	1.3. Update the parser and transformer to support new grammar constructs
	1.4. Add comprehensive tests for parsing and semantic model of UI/data primitives
	1.5. Document usage patterns and examples in the documentation and example library

#### 2. Agent Feedback Simulation Framework
	2.1. Design a feedback protocol for agents to submit, receive, and act on feedback
	2.2. Implement feedback hooks in the interpreter and semantic model
	2.3. Create simulation/test harnesses for agent feedback scenarios
	2.4. Add feedback-driven evolution examples and tests

#### 3. Cogent Native Execution & Runtime Evolution
	3.1. Define the Cogent Virtual Machine (Cogent VM) or interpreter for direct execution of Cogent modules
	3.2. Design and implement the core runtime and execution semantics for Cogent
	3.3. Develop a standard library of primitives and utilities in Cogent itself
	3.4. Integrate runtime with agent-driven optimization and self-evolution mechanisms
	3.5. Add tests and examples for Cogent-native execution and runtime features

#### 4. State & Event Handling
	4.1. Extend grammar and semantic model to support persistent data models and state
	4.2. Add event-driven constructs (e.g., onClick, onSubmit, triggers)
	4.3. Update interpreter and code generators to handle state and events
	4.4. Add tests and documentation for stateful/event-driven modules

#### 5. Standard Library
	5.1. Identify and design a core set of reusable types, functions, and UI components
	5.2. Implement and document the standard library
	5.3. Add tests and usage examples for standard library features

#### 6. Security & Access Control
	6.1. Define grammar and semantic model constructs for authentication, authorization, and security policies
	6.2. Integrate security features into interpreter and code generation
	6.3. Add tests and documentation for security features

#### 7. Continuous Integration & Documentation
	7.1. Ensure all new features are covered by tests and documentation
	7.2. Update changelog and roadmap with each milestone
	7.3. Solicit and incorporate agent/human feedback at each stage

## Philosophy

- **AI-Native, Human-Interpretable:** Designed for agentic reasoning, simulation, and evolution, but always with human auditability and collaboration in mind.
- **Self-Evolving:** Feedback loops, versioning, and agent-driven proposals are core to language evolution.

Stay tuned to the [changelog](changelog.md) for detailed progress.
Annotations & Metadata: Modules, inputs, and steps can have arbitrary metadata, which is important for agent communication and extensibility.

Imports & Composition: Modules can import other modules, supporting modular design.
