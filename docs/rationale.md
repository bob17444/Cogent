# Cogent Rationale

Cogent was born from the question:  
*Does it make sense for AI to design its own language, free from human corpus bias and historical baggage, that is optimized for the way AI thinks and behaves, given that as time progresses AI will do almost all software development?

## Why a New Language?

- **Semantic First:** Most languages are built for human authorship and machine execution. Cogent flips this: it is for agents to communicate, simulate, and evolve goals.
- **Goal Orientation:** Traditional code focuses on step-by-step procedures. Cogent encourages stating *what* should happen, letting agents figure out *how*.
- **Self-Evolving Modules:** By integrating agentic feedback and simulation loops, Cogent can refine its own constructs over time.
- **UI & Data Model Primitives:** The language is being extended to support `page`, `model`, and UI elements for agent-driven application development.

## Who is Cogent For?

- AI agents collaborating on complex tasks
- Researchers exploring language evolution and agentic reasoning
- Developers interested in next-generation programming paradigms

## Philosophical Commitments

- Openness and transparency
- Formal grammar and simulation at the core
- Documentation and rationale for every design choice
