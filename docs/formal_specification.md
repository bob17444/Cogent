# Cogent Language Formal Specification

## 1. Introduction
Cogent is an AI-native, agent-optimized programming language designed for agentic reasoning, simulation, and self-evolution. Its primary goal is to enable both AI agents and humans to collaboratively design, analyze, and evolve software systems with clear semantics, extensibility, and auditability.

## 2. Syntax, Semantics, and Execution Model

- **Syntax:**
  - Defined using EBNF (see `grammar/cogent.ebnf`).
  - Designed for readability, extensibility, and agentic manipulation.
  - Supports modular, declarative constructs for processes, types, UI/data models, and metadata.

- **Semantics:**
  - Each syntactic construct has a well-defined meaning, captured in the semantic model (see interpreter implementation).
  - Semantics are explicit and auditable, supporting both static analysis and dynamic execution.
  - Metadata and annotations are first-class, enabling agent-driven optimization and evolution.

- **Execution Model:**
  - Cogent modules are executed directly by the Cogent VM/interpreter, not transpiled to other languages.
  - The execution model supports process orchestration, state management, event handling, and agent feedback.
  - Resource profiling, error handling, and security are integrated into the runtime.

This separation guides the design of the Cogent VM/runtime and supports agentic evolution, allowing both agents and humans to propose, analyze, and safely integrate new features or optimizations.

## 3. Agent Feedback, Metadata, and Telemetry

Cogent is designed for seamless integration with AI agents through the following mechanisms:

- **Metadata & Annotations:**
    - Cogent modules, types, steps, and inputs can include arbitrary metadata fields (annotations).
    - These fields are used for agent communication, feedback, optimization proposals, and performance metrics.
    - Agents can read, interpret, and update these fields as part of the languageâ€™s self-evolution process.

- **Resource Profiling & Telemetry:**
    - Execution traces, profiling data, and telemetry are collected by the Cogent runtime.
    - This information is made available to agents for optimization, debugging, and analysis.

- **Feedback Protocol:**
    - Cogent includes a formal feedback protocol (see Section 12) that allows agents to submit, receive, and act on feedback in a standardized way.
    - This enables closed feedback loops for agent-driven improvement and evolution.

- **Simulation/Test Harnesses:**
    - Agents (or humans) can run Cogent modules in simulation mode, capturing outputs, resource usage, and telemetry.
    - Simulation results can be used to propose changes, optimizations, or new features.
    - Test harnesses enable automated validation of agent proposals and feedback-driven evolution scenarios.

These mechanisms ensure that Cogent is not only executable and auditable, but also nativelgit checkout main
git pully supports agent-driven development, optimization, and self-evolution.

## 4. Design Philosophy
- **AI-Native, Human-Interpretable:** Cogent is optimized for agent-driven development, but always with human auditability and collaboration in mind.
- **Self-Evolving:** Feedback loops, versioning, and agent-driven proposals are core to language evolution.
- **Extensible & Modular:** Supports modular design, metadata annotations, and extensibility for new features.

## 5. Core Language Constructs
### 5.1 Modules
- Encapsulate code, types, and metadata.
- Support imports and composition.

### 5.2 Types & Enums
- Strongly-typed system with user-defined types and enums.
- Type parameters and generics supported.

### 5.3 Processes & Steps
- Declarative process definitions with ordered or parallel steps.
- Support for loops (`for`, `while`), branching, and error handling (`try/catch`).

### 5.4 UI & Data Model Primitives
- Primitives for `page`, `model`, and UI elements (label, input, button, etc.).
- Data models are first-class, supporting persistent state and validation.

### 5.5 Annotations & Metadata
- Arbitrary metadata can be attached to modules, types, steps, and inputs.
- Used for agent communication, optimization, and extensibility.

## 6. Grammar & Syntax
- Defined in EBNF (see `grammar/cogent.ebnf`).
- Extensible to support new constructs and agent-driven proposals.

## 7. Interpreter & Execution Model
- Python-based reference interpreter.
- Direct execution of Cogent modules (no transpilation to other languages).
- Semantic model mirrors language constructs for analysis and execution.
- Resource profiling and agent feedback hooks integrated.

## 8. Error Handling & Diagnostics
- Robust error reporting and diagnostics for parsing, semantic analysis, and execution.
- Support for agent/human feedback on errors and optimization proposals.

## 9. Module System
- Modules can import other modules.
- Namespaces and dependency management supported.

## 10. Versioning & Evolution
- Language and runtime are versioned.
- Migration and backward compatibility mechanisms planned.
- Agent-driven proposals and feedback loops guide evolution.

## 11. Security & Access Control
- Constructs for authentication, authorization, and security policies (planned).
- Sensitive data is access-controlled and never exposed outside authorized boundaries.

## 12. Standard Library
- Core set of reusable types, functions, and UI components (planned).
- Evolved collaboratively by agents and humans.

## 13. Testing & Continuous Integration
- Comprehensive test suite for parsing, semantic model, and new features.
- All new features require tests and documentation.

## 14. Feedback Protocol

Cogent includes a formal feedback protocol to enable closed feedback loops between the language/runtime and AI agents:

- Agents can submit, receive, and act on feedback in a standardized way (e.g., via structured metadata, events, or API calls).
- Feedback may include optimization proposals, error reports, performance metrics, or suggestions for language evolution.
- The protocol supports both synchronous and asynchronous feedback, and is versioned for compatibility.
- This enables agent-driven improvement, self-evolution, and collaborative optimization of Cogent programs and the language itself.

## 15. Simulation and Test Harnesses

Cogent supports agentic reasoning and evolution through simulation and test harnesses:

- Agents (or humans) can run Cogent modules in simulation mode, capturing outputs, resource usage, and telemetry.
- Simulation results can be used to propose changes, optimizations, or new features.
- Test harnesses enable automated validation of agent proposals and feedback-driven evolution scenarios.
- These mechanisms ensure safe, auditable, and effective agent-driven development and optimization.

## 16. Extensibility Hooks
Well-defined extension points for agents to propose, test, and integrate new features or optimizations.

## 17. Development Environments (Hybrid Model)

Cogent supports a hybrid development environment model:

- **AI-Optimized Core:** The primary Cogent environment is API-first and headless, designed for agentic workflows, simulation, and self-evolution.
- **Human-Facing UI Layers:** Optional VS Code extensions and web IDEs provide syntax highlighting, visualization, and collaborative editing for human contributors and auditors.
- Both environments interact via a unified API, ensuring seamless agent/human collaboration and extensibility.

## 18. Documentation & Guidelines
Rationale, roadmap, changelog, and optimization guidelines are maintained and versioned.
Clear contribution, feedback, and metadata standards for agentic and human contributors.
