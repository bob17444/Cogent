# Cogent Interpreter Prototype

This directory contains the initial scaffold for the Cogent interpreter, designed to enable both AI agents and humans to reason about, execute, and evolve Cogent modules.

## Alignment with Cogent Principles

- **Goal-oriented:** Interpreter mirrors Cogent’s goal/process/input model.
- **Semantic clarity:** Structured, readable code and explicit models.
- **Agent-centric:** APIs are designed for agent transparency and feedback.
- **Traceability:** Telemetry and resource profiling stubs for full provenance.
- **Extensibility:** Modular stubs for future self-evolving features.

## Components

- `parser.py` — Parses `.cg` files using the formal grammar.
- `semantic_model.py` — In-memory representations of modules, goals, etc.
- `agent_api.py` — Methods for agents to inspect and (eventually) propose edits.
- `resource_profiler.py` — (Stub) For agentic resource negotiation.
- `telemetry.py` — (Stub) For logging and feedback loops.
- `__init__.py` — Python package marker.

## Testing

Run all tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

Test coverage includes:
- Minimal and complex modules
- Optional/required fields
- Edge cases (empty lists, multiple modules, etc.)
