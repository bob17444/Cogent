# Cogent Interpreter Architecture

## Overview

Cogent is an AI-native programming language, engineered for and by agents. The interpreter’s architecture is designed to empower agents to reason, adapt, and optimize code for clarity, resource efficiency, and rapid evolution. Every component is built to maximize agent usability, feedback, and self-improvement, while ensuring safety, traceability, and performance at scale.

## Design Principles

- **AI-Centric:** Every feature and interface is tailored to agent consumption, learning, and optimization.
- **Semantic-First:** Modules emphasize intentions and outcomes, not stepwise control.
- **Goal-Driven Execution:** Agents focus on achieving stated results, not rote procedure.
- **Self-Evolution:** Modules and interpreter adapt based on agentic feedback, simulation, and versioning.
- **Transparent Provenance:** Every decision, mutation, and resource profile is logged and auditable.
- **Resource Optimization:** Memory, CPU, storage, I/O, network, energy, and cost are first-class citizens.
- **Security & Threat Mitigation:** Robust agent isolation, audit, and permissioning to prevent abuse in agent-dense, adversarial, or distributed environments.

## Core Components

### 1. Parser
- Converts Cogent source into structured, semantic trees.
- Emits parse efficiency and memory metrics.
- Designed for incremental parsing to support agent-driven grammar evolution.

### 2. Semantic Model
- Represents goals, context, inputs, process, and agent feedback.
- Enables agents to query, mutate, and propose refinements to module structure.
- Minimal, composable, and designed for future extensibility.

### 3. Goal Engine
- Interprets goal/context blocks and proposes solution strategies.
- Exposes APIs for agents to simulate, select, or invent new approaches.
- Evaluates strategies in light of resource, security, and semantic constraints.

### 4. Process Simulator
- Runs agent-proposed or module-defined processes, tracking resource use.
- Allows parallel, distributed, or deterministic/non-deterministic simulation.
- Integrates real-world or synthetic feedback for agent learning loops.

### 5. Feedback Integrator
- Accepts structured agent feedback on performance, clarity, results, and efficiency.
- Supports agent-initiated or autonomous module revision.
- Maintains a versioned, auditable evolution history.

### 6. Trace & Telemetry Log
- Records all agent actions, feedback, resource usage, errors, and provenance.
- Supports real-time and retrospective analysis for agent learning and debugging.

### 7. Resource Profiler & Optimizer
- Monitors memory, CPU, I/O, network, energy, and cost per process, agent, and module.
- Suggests and, if authorized, applies optimizations.
- Enables agents to reason about, negotiate, or compete for resources.

### 8. Fault Tolerance & Recovery Manager
- Detects, logs, and recovers from errors, exhaustion, or agent failure.
- Checkpoints state for rollback and reproducibility.
- Notifies agents and supports collaborative recovery.

### 9. Module Versioning & Provenance Tracker
- Tracks each module’s lineage, feedback-driven mutations, and agent authorship.
- Ensures reproducibility and transparency for self-evolving codebases.

### 10. Agent Interface & API
- Standardized lifecycle for agent engagement: propose, simulate, critique, revise.
- Secure, auditable, and supports both local and remote agents.
- Protocols for agent authentication, capability declaration, and resource negotiation.

## Security Model & Threat Mitigation

Cogent’s interpreter treats security as central, recognizing agents may be adversarial, malfunctioning, or resource-hungry. The following mechanisms are implemented:

### Agent Isolation and Sandboxing
- Each agent operates in a strict sandbox (process/container/VM as appropriate).
- No agent can access another’s memory, code, or state except by approved API or message bus.

### Resource Quotas and Rate Limiting
- Agents and modules are assigned resource budgets (CPU, memory, storage, I/O, network, energy, cost).
- Hard and soft limits enforced; overruns lead to throttling, notification, or termination.
- Quotas are auditable and can be negotiated or adjusted by consensus or admin policy.

### Permission Model
- Agents and modules are assigned explicit capabilities (read, write, simulate, propose, mutate).
- Fine-grained permissioning for sensitive operations (grammar mutation, process injection, feedback integration).
- All permission grants, denials, and escalations are logged.

### Secure Provenance and Audit Trails
- Every action, mutation, feedback, and resource use is cryptographically signed and recorded.
- Full audit support for forensic analysis and rollback.

### Threat Detection and Response
- Continuous monitoring for anomalous agent behavior, feedback loops, or resource patterns.
- Automated mitigation: isolate, throttle, terminate, or quarantine agents showing suspicious activity.
- Notification system for human administrators or supervising agents.

### Determinism and Reproducibility
- Supports deterministic simulation for forensic traceability and security auditing.
- Optionally allows non-deterministic runs with full trace logging for debugging or exploration.

### Secure Communication and Data Handling
- All inter-agent and agent-interpreter communication is encrypted and authenticated.
- Sensitive data (inputs, outputs, context) is access-controlled and never exposed outside authorized boundaries.

### Fault Injection and Red Teaming
- Supports intentional injection of faults, adversarial agents, or resource stress to test system resilience.
- Logs and learns from all security incidents to improve future robustness.

## Advanced Resource Optimization

- **Energy-Aware Execution:** Agents may optimize for energy use, not just performance.
- **Concurrency and Distribution:** Interpreter natively supports multi-core, cluster, and cloud deployment, enabling agents to exploit parallelism.
- **Data Locality & Caching:** Agents and modules can express preferences or constraints for data locality to minimize I/O and network costs.
- **Cost Awareness:** Tracks and allows optimization for monetary cost, suitable for cloud or commercial deployments.
- **Latency Optimization:** Agents can reason about and optimize for end-to-end latency in time-critical modules.
- **Garbage Collection & Reclamation:** Automated cleanup and feedback on resource usage for agents.
- **Scalability:** Interpreter is designed to scale up (hardware) and out (distributed/cloud), with agent-driven load balancing.
- **Internationalization:** Full Unicode and locale support for multi-lingual, global agent populations.

---

## Error Handling and Exception Model

- **Structured Error Types:** All errors are structured, typed, and include context for agent debugging.
- **Agent-Driven Recovery:** Agents can register for error events, propose or vote on recovery actions.
- **Fallback and Rollback:** Interpreter supports rollback to last stable checkpoint on irrecoverable errors.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** All exceptions and recovery actions are logged for traceability.

---

## Testing, Verification, and Module Evolution

- **Formal Verification Hooks:** Interpreter enables agents to propose or check invariants and properties.
- **Simulation-Driven Testing:** Agents can run modules through simulated environments for regression and stress testing.
- **Continuous Integration for Modules:** Interpreter supports automated regression and security tests as modules evolve.

---

## Deployment, Integration, and Community

- **Deployment Modes:** Interpreter can run as CLI, service, or embeddable library. All interfaces are agent- and API-friendly.
- **Extensibility:** New agent types, grammars, simulators, and optimizers can be plugged in at runtime.
- **Contribution Guidelines:** Both agents and humans can propose language extensions, subject to security review and audit.
- **Example Workflows:** Documentation includes full lifecycle of module creation, simulation, agent feedback, and self-evolution.

## Next Steps

- Prototype parser and semantic model with agent API.
- Implement security sandbox, resource quotas, and audit trail.
- Design agent permissioning and authentication flows.
- Build agent-driven simulation and feedback interfaces.
- Develop testing, verification, and module evolution workflows.
